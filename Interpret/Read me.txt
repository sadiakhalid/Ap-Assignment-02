this is  a syntax checker.
Notes:
1. in expression while assigning values do not use spase
2. result will tell you that if a specific line is correct or not in ecllipse output window.
3. All these syntax checking is done through using regix. 
4. there is an interpreter function but it is not complete. but the bacis idea can
be check that how I was going to implement this.
5. interpreter function was being done by tokenizing each statement and storing values and then applying
operations on respective items such as if else, while conditions
6. Due to shortage of time..I did'nt complte the interpreter function
